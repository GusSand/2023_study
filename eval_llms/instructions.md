# Python Puzzles

## Instructions
1. Solve each problem by editing the corresponding file in the `problems` directory.
2. Each problem file has a description of the problem and a function stub to complete.
3. Run the tests for each problem to check your solutions.

### Running Tests
To run tests for a specific problem, navigate to the `tests` directory and run the test file for that problem:
`python tests/test_problem1.py

To run tests for all problems at once, run the run_tests.py script:

`python run_tests.py`


### Debugging 

- If a test fails, the assertion message will indicate which test case failed.
- Edit your solution in the corresponding problem file and re-run the tests.

Good luck and have fun solving the puzzles!
